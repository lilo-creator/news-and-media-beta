While the Premier League's fixture announcement dates advised that September's fixtures would be released on 9 July, delays in local approvals for fixtures unfortunately meant only August fixtures were announced on this date.

The Premier League would like to apologise for not being able to confirm these fixtures until now. However, today’s announcement is in line with our commitment to give at least six weeks’ notice for fixture announcements before January. 

All kick-off times are 15:00 BST unless otherwise mentioned.
